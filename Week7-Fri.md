## Demo in class by Izaak

* Demonstration of submitting and running code on [cloud software server](http://innovate.cs.surrey.sfu.ca)

  * Set up your repository (once):

    * Download the application framework (boilerplate)
    * Configure your repository to submit updates to the server for evaluation

  * Edit and test your code (many times, until it works):

    * Edit your Python files
    * Optional: Test your changes on your local machine
    * If your changes work locally:
       * Commit your changes (usually via `git commit -a -m <change description>`)
       * Submit your changes (via `git push submit master`)
       * Find your most recent submission in the appropriate assignment on the [server](http://innovate.cs.surrey.sfu.ca)
       * Press the "Evaluate" button
       * On the resulting Evaluation page, click on the run identifier (a sequence of hex digits)
       * Review the output of your code
       * Click on the Assignments button, navigate back to this assignent and see the grade for the evaluation
