## In-class activity

### Access key

1. Check: Everyone has an AWS access key ID and secret access key
2. Everyone knows the path to the file containing their access key
3. Test: Access function works

  * Sign on to your EC2 instance.
  * Copy your credentials file from your machine to your instance:
    * On Mac OS and Linux: `scp CREDENTIALS-FILE ubuntu@IP-ADDRESS`, where `CREDENTIALS-FILE` is the path to your access key credentials, downloaded from Amazon, and `IP-ADDRESS` is the public IP address of the instance (the address you connected to via ssh).
    * On Windows: Download [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) and use that to send `CREDENTIALS-FILE` to the EC2 instance.
  * Check if you have git installed (probably not): if the command `which git` displays a path, you **have git**.
  * If you need git, install it: `sudo apt-get install git`.
  * Get the test code: `git clone https://gist.github.com/8553680.git`
  * Run the test:
<pre><code>    $ cd {{ page.gist-name }}
    $ python
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import testcreds
    &gt;&gt;&gt; testcreds.test('YOUR-CREDENTIALS-PATH') 
</code></pre>

replacing `YOUR-CREDENTIALS-PATH` with the absolute path to your credentials file. The path will begin with `/home/ubuntu/`.

#### To download the latest version of the test software

The test software has been revised. To download it _to your EC2 instance_, sign on to your EC2 instance and

<pre><code>$ cd {{ page.gist-name }}
$ git pull
</code></pre>

You will see some messages from `git`.

Now run the test using the instructions above.

#### Analyzing your test results

**If the test succeeds**, you will see `Test SUCCEEDED`. Congratulations! You won't have to do these steps again for this EC2
instance. These changes will be retained even if you stop and then restart
the instance.

**If you get a Python file IO error**, it is most likely that the path to the credentials file is incorrect.

**If you get a 403 Permissions error**, and your access key is for an IAM id, it is likely that your IAM id does not have a full range of permissions. In the IAM console, select your ID and go to the Permissions tab. View the policies for your id. They should include one like the following:

<pre><code>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

#### Another way to use your access keys

Redditor `sickan90` suggests an alternative approach: Placing your
access keys into the boto configuration file. See their
[post on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/sfu_innovation/comments/1vwkbb/an_easy_way_to_setup_your_credentials_to_sqs/).

Thanks, `sickan90`!

### Groups for Assignment 2

1. Groups of 1 or 2.
2. Form a group using CourSys group facilities. (Form own group, invite another to join yours, accept/decline invitations.)
3. Groups formed by midnight Thursday (tomorrow).

### Structure of the assignment

See [My Little Image Sharer](a2.html).

* Creating a service that distributes images.
* Service has two subservices.
* Customer-facing service called `server`.
* Server stores images into S3 (we provide code).
* Server sends message to `worker` subservice behind the scenes.
* You write the connection between worker and server using SQS.
* Worker creates thumbnails of images and stores thumbnails
* We provide thumbnail code
* You provide communications code between worker and server

## Reading guide for next class

Read the following before coming to the next class:

**[{{ site.data.bibliography.dean2013.title }}]({{ site.data.bibliography.dean2013.url }})**,
from beginning up to but not including "Cross-request long-term adaptations".

The key points:

* _latency_ is the length of time for a request to complete
* The sources of variability in system response
* The algorithm for hedged requests (p.&nbsp;77)

Less important:

* The middle section on "reducing component variability". This is good
  advice on how to improve response time for individual requests (including
  subrequests) but we are interested in how to improve response time for
  _multiple_ subrequests comprising a larger request.
