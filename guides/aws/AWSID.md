During the first weeks of the course, you will be building an application across multiple virtual machines running under Amazon Web Services (AWS). You will build this project in stages.

This week's stage is administrative: You will create an AWS and set its security parameters. This is at once both trivial and tedious. It takes several hours of work and at the end you won't have a single line of code to show for it. But it is a prerequisite for everything we do in the coming weeks, so best to start now.
